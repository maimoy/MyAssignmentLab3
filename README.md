My Assignment to Lab 3 for merging data from different sources in Mongo

I tried it to make it finishing the job without any record staying unwritten and unmerged and writing all the records in MongoDB giving any number as step for batch inserting the records 
not only steps multiplied by a number (ex. 10, 100, 50, 20) of the 1.000 records that is for this test but any number.  
The command should be node my-migrate-data.js X (X any number for records in one chunk).
The server.js file is my first failed try.
